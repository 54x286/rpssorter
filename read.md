💫 NCT WISH RPS Sorter
Welcome to my NCT WISH RPS Sorter repository — a personal, open-source project designed to help fans explore and visualize their RPS (Real Person Slash) ranking preferences within NCT WISH.

This project began as a lighthearted way for me to reflect on my favorite dynamics and narratives, but I also hope it becomes a useful and insightful tool for others in the fandom. Whether you're here to sort your ships, analyze emotional patterns, or simply have fun — you're welcome.

🧠 Purpose
Personal Reference: A tracker to visualize the evolution of my RPS preferences over time.

Community Insight: To provide a transparent, customizable sorter for fellow fans, researchers, or fanfic writers.

Interactive Engagement: Offering a gamified way to introspect your ship dynamics — from casual interest to OTPs.
